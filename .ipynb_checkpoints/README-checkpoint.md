## Process
### (your step 1)
### (your step 2)


These were the 2 goals that guide our analytical process:

goals in mind:

To understand what happened in the data - part of how we understand what transpired in the past is by spotting patterns in the data.
To understand the state of the whole - using a representative sample from the past, we try to make a reasonable inference about the population.
So now we have a sample of 9 stations. More below, we will filter our get request by those locations and connect them with the searches done at the Yelp to build our machine learning model.




If the "Rating" is assigned based on a predefined set of categories (e.g. Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor), and the distance between each category is not known or meaningful, then it would be considered an ordinal variable. If the "Rating" is a continuous measure of quality, with meaningful differences between any two adjacent ratings, then it would be considered an interval variable.


I didin't know that some websites require you to create an account or app (such as Yelp) in order to use their API. This is a common practice among most API providers as it helps them track usage and bill for usage. Without an API key, you will not be able to make any requests to Yelp's API.
It's worth noting that creating an app is a simple process that typically only requires you to provide some basic information about the app, such as its name and purpose. Once your app is created, you will be able to obtain an API key and start making requests to Yelp's API.

## Results
(fill in what you found about the comparative quality of API coverage in your chosen area and the results of your model.)
